# StockPrediction
30 days Prediction with 3 different models

# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning  

### 🚀 Overview  
This project builds a **stock price prediction model** using machine learning. It trains on multiple stocks (e.g., Google, Microsoft) and forecasts future prices. The approach includes **feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation using key metrics**.

## 🔍 Key Features  
**Multi-Stock Learning** – Trained on multiple stocks instead of just one.  
**Three ML Models Compared** – Evaluates the best-performing model.  
**Time-Series Feature Engineering** – Uses historical prices to predict future trends.  
**Next 30-Day Forecast** – Predicts stock prices for the next month.  
**Visualized Performance** – Plots actual vs predicted prices & errors.
